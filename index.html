						<p> <b>Abstract: </b> <i style="color: cadetblue;">Text classification is one of the most
								important tasks in Natural Language Processing. As text
								data is growing rapidly, it needs more computational
								power to classify the text in a big dataset. The task
								is difficult for characteristic-rich languages like Bangla.
								Having good-quality text data significantly affects the
								outcome of the model that has been used to classify
								them. Nowadays, social media can be an important
								source of information. But there is a huge number of
								data which are of no use. As the use of social media is
								increasing day by day, people are posting about events
								around their surroundings. So, it can be an important
								propaganda of the media. In this study, various text
								classification methods were used to classify the texts
								in Bangla from social media, which can be categorized
								as emergencies that may need immediate actions from
								the government, local authority, or law enforcement or
								even may need international attention. Therefore, 5839
								social media posts were collected from Facebook and
								Twitter, which were written in Bangla along with some
								mixed English words. Then, after preprocessing, various Machine Learning models, Deep
								Neural Network
								models, and Transformer based models were applied to
								classify them. Among these models, transformer-based
								XLM-RoBERTa outperformed all the other models
								with an F1-score of 95.25.</i></p>

						<p> <b>Abstract: </b> <i style="color: cadetblue;">Natural Language Processing (NLP) has entered
								a new era with the advent
								of pre-trained language models, paving the way for constructing robust language models.
								Pretrained transformer-based models such as GPT-2 have become prevalent due to their
								cutting-edge efficiency. However, these approaches rely heavily on resource-intensive
								languages, forcing other languages to adopt multilingual frameworks (mGPT). The mGPT
								model could perform better for low-resource languages such as Bangla because the model
								has been trained on a diverse dataset spanning multiple languages. Recent studies show
								that the language-specific GPT model outperforms the multilingual mGPT model. In this
								research, we have proposed a pretrained monolingual GPT model called BanglaGPT using the
								objective of causal language modeling (CLM). Due to the lack of available large datasets
								for NLP tasks in Bangla, we have created a Bangla language model dataset called
								BanglaCLM using a 26.24 GB Bangla corpus scraped from several public websites. We have
								used a subword-based tokenization algorithm named Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for Bangla
								and finally trained the Bangla-GPT2 model from scratch using the BanglaCLM dataset. Our
								pretrained BanglaGPT provides state-of-the-art performance for Bangla text generation
								with a perplexity score of 2.86 and a loss score of 0.45 on the test set.</i></p>

						<p> <b>Abstract: </b> <i style="color: cadetblue;">Motor imagery classification is an important
								area of research that aims
								to provide insights into the neural processes underlying motor control. By analyzing the
								patterns of brain activity related to imagined movement, researchers can better
								understand how the brain originates and controls voluntary movements. This knowledge can
								have significant implications for the development of novel therapies for neurological
								diseases that impact motor performance, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. In this
								study, the performance of three deep learning methods, including Artificial Neural
								Networks (ANNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
								(Bi-LSTM), were evaluated for the classification of motor imagery EEG data. The results
								of the study showed that DNNs and Bi-LSTM performed better than the other algorithms
								with Bi-LSTM obtaining the highest average accuracy 96.84%, sensitivity 95%, specificity
								98.72%, F1-score 96.80%. This finding highlights the potential of these methods for
								EEG-based BCI applications. Moreover, a detailed comparison of several deep learning
								methods for the classification of motor imagery was presented, providing useful insights
								for future research toward the development of efficient and accurate BCIs. In
								conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of DNNs and Bi-LSTM for the
								classification of motor imagery EEG data and their potential for use in the development
								of BCIs for neurological diseases. These findings can guide future research in the field
								and contribute to the development of more efficient and accurate BCIs.</i></p>

				<li><b>BConvQA: A Bangla Conversational Question-Answering Model Using Transformer-based
						Architecture</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i style="color: cadetblue;">Conversational interactions, integral to
							human communication, pose a challenge for virtual assistants due to contextual
							understanding limitations.
							Designing an effective Bangla Context-based Conversational Question Answering (CCQA)
							system faces hurdles like data scarcity, translation quality, and model availability.
							Our approach involved translating CoQA and QuAC datasets into Bangla using Google API
							and BanglaNMT, enhanced with LaBSE model. We utilized sequence-to-sequence models,
							particularly BanglaT5, fine-tuned on our BCoQA dataset through a structured pipeline.
							Fine-tuning on Squad_bn dataset before BCoQA significantly improved BanglaT5's
							performance. Quantitative benchmarks showed its superiority in Exact Match and F1
							scores. Qualitative analysis affirmed its competency in maintaining conversation
							context. In conclusion, our BanglaT5-based BConvQA system exhibits promising
							performance, laying a foundation for Bangla question-answering applications.
							Further research is needed to address limitations in handling out-of-context queries and
							deepening language understanding.</i>

				<li><b>Suggesting Bengali words using Masked Language Model</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<i style="color: cadetblue;">This study explores Bangla word suggestion in texts using a
							fine-tuned Bangla-BERT model with Masked Language Modeling (MLM).
							While transformer-based models like BERT have revolutionized natural language processing
							(NLP), the availability of task-specific datasets, especially for word-suggesting in Bangla,
							is limited.
							This research addresses this gap by employing MLM to predict Bangla words. Sub-word
							tokenization enhances the model's ability to handle unknown words. Unlike existing
							pretrained BanglaBERT model that uses word-piece masking, we experiment with dynamic
							whole-word masking algorithms.
							Our research aims to analyze the performance of the fine-tuned BanglaBERT model under
							different masking strategies and compare results to the traditional BanglaBERT approach.</i>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<li><b>Correction of Bangla sentences with Guruchondali Dosh</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li><i style="color: cadetblue;">This research tackles the prevalent issue of Guruchondali Dosh, the
							inadvertent mixing of
							Shadhu and Cholito styles in Bangla language documents.
							With approximately 250-300 million Bangla speakers globally, the digital representation of
							the language faces challenges, including the lack of tools to identify Guruchondali Dosh.
							The research presents an algorithm to detect the writing style in a Bangla document and
							correct Guruchondali Dosh errors, primarily favoring the widely used Cholito style.
							The proposed solution combines rule-based techniques and machine learning with transformers,
							aiming to enhance the overall quality of Bangla language content in the digital space.</i>

				<li><b>Automatic Text Summarization in Bengali: A Study on the Effectiveness of the mT5 Transformer
						Model</b></li>
				<ul>
					<li><i style="color: cadetblue;">Our research introduces a Bangla text-generation model using the
							mT5 transformer, fine-tuned
							on a newly created Bangla Summarization Dataset (BSD).
							This model aims to produce concise and fluent summaries while preserving key
							information.</i></li>
				</ul>
				<br>
				<li><b>Building a Bangla Text Summarization Dataset for Transformer Models: A Comprehensive Guide</b>
				</li>
				<ul>
					<li><i style="color: cadetblue;">
							The research on Bangla text summarization faced challenges due to the rarity of datasets.
							Initially, data collection was manual from various websites, which proved time-consuming.
							To streamline the process, a Python-based scraper was developed and deployed on
							https://www.kalerkantho.com/, a Bengali newspaper website. The scraper automated data
							collection, and the information was stored in JSON files, with each file termed as a
							"chunk." In total, eight datasets were created.
							The entries in the dataset consist of content (text for summarization) and title (summary).

					<p>I have experience in programming using C++ and Python. I have finished several projects, such as
						a chatbot for university information, websites for evaluating students, a personal voice
						assistant, and a file locker that uses an encryption algorithm. Recently, I have been working on
						LLM and langchain. I am trying to retrain and finetuned the LLM models using the PEFT library. I
						have also completed machine learning projects such as fake note detection, human abnormality
						detection, brain tumour detection, and an intelligent chatbot. I have also finished some natural
						language processing projects, like an intelligent chatbot that uses LSTM, Bangla text
						summarization using a transformer model, Bangla keyboard error correction using a transformer
						model, a Bangla stemmer design, a Bangla word-to-vector conversion, and a chatbot that uses the
						seq2seq model. I also have experience in hardware projects such as Home Automation using IoT and
						an image processing project, Fake Bangladeshi currency detection using OpenCV. Furthermore, I
						have experience in database management using MySQL.</p>
