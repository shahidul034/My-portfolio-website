						<p> 🎯 <i style="color: cadetblue;">Text classification is one of the most
								important tasks in Natural Language Processing. As text
								data is growing rapidly, it needs more computational
								power to classify the text in a big dataset. The task
								is difficult for characteristic-rich languages like Bangla.
								Having good-quality text data significantly affects the
								outcome of the model that has been used to classify
								them. Nowadays, social media can be an important
								source of information. But there is a huge number of
								data which are of no use. As the use of social media is
								increasing day by day, people are posting about events
								around their surroundings. So, it can be an important
								propaganda of the media. In this study, various text
								classification methods were used to classify the texts
								in Bangla from social media, which can be categorized
								as emergencies that may need immediate actions from
								the government, local authority, or law enforcement or
								even may need international attention. Therefore, 5839
								social media posts were collected from Facebook and
								Twitter, which were written in Bangla along with some
								mixed English words. Then, after preprocessing, various Machine Learning models, Deep
								Neural Network
								models, and Transformer based models were applied to
								classify them. Among these models, transformer-based
								XLM-RoBERTa outperformed all the other models
								with an F1-score of 95.25.</i></p>

						<p> 🎯 <i style="color: cadetblue;">Natural Language Processing (NLP) has entered
								a new era with the advent
								of pre-trained language models, paving the way for constructing robust language models.
								Pretrained transformer-based models such as GPT-2 have become prevalent due to their
								cutting-edge efficiency. However, these approaches rely heavily on resource-intensive
								languages, forcing other languages to adopt multilingual frameworks (mGPT). The mGPT
								model could perform better for low-resource languages such as Bangla because the model
								has been trained on a diverse dataset spanning multiple languages. Recent studies show
								that the language-specific GPT model outperforms the multilingual mGPT model. In this
								research, we have proposed a pretrained monolingual GPT model called BanglaGPT using the
								objective of causal language modeling (CLM). Due to the lack of available large datasets
								for NLP tasks in Bangla, we have created a Bangla language model dataset called
								BanglaCLM using a 26.24 GB Bangla corpus scraped from several public websites. We have
								used a subword-based tokenization algorithm named Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) for Bangla
								and finally trained the Bangla-GPT2 model from scratch using the BanglaCLM dataset. Our
								pretrained BanglaGPT provides state-of-the-art performance for Bangla text generation
								with a perplexity score of 2.86 and a loss score of 0.45 on the test set.</i></p>

						<p> 🎯 <i style="color: cadetblue;">Motor imagery classification is an important
								area of research that aims
								to provide insights into the neural processes underlying motor control. By analyzing the
								patterns of brain activity related to imagined movement, researchers can better
								understand how the brain originates and controls voluntary movements. This knowledge can
								have significant implications for the development of novel therapies for neurological
								diseases that impact motor performance, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. In this
								study, the performance of three deep learning methods, including Artificial Neural
								Networks (ANNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
								(Bi-LSTM), were evaluated for the classification of motor imagery EEG data. The results
								of the study showed that DNNs and Bi-LSTM performed better than the other algorithms
								with Bi-LSTM obtaining the highest average accuracy 96.84%, sensitivity 95%, specificity
								98.72%, F1-score 96.80%. This finding highlights the potential of these methods for
								EEG-based BCI applications. Moreover, a detailed comparison of several deep learning
								methods for the classification of motor imagery was presented, providing useful insights
								for future research toward the development of efficient and accurate BCIs. In
								conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of DNNs and Bi-LSTM for the
								classification of motor imagery EEG data and their potential for use in the development

					<div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
						<p> 🎯 <i style="color: cadetblue;">When a behavior is regarded as unusual in
								particular circumstances, it
								is termed abnormal. The term "abnormal behavior" has many definitions depending on the
								situation. People sprinting in a field, for example, is regarded natural, but it appears
								weird if it occurs in a mall. Similarly, loitering in alleyways, arguing, or pushing
								each other in public places are all regarded weird in certain situations. Deep learning
								has been widely used in the computer vision sector in recent years, with considerable
								success in human activity recognition. The proposed technique helps in the detection of
								abnormal behavior under a variety of contexts, including background changes, the number
								of subjects (one, two people, or a crowd), and a variety of unusual human behaviors.</i>

				<li><b>LLM based QA chatbot builder: A generative AI-based chatbot for question answering(Submitted to
						softwareX)</b></li>
				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This software describes the development of a web application
					called
					the LLM QA Builder, designed to streamline the creation of LLM-based interactive chatbots
					for organizational information retrieval.
					The application integrates various development phases including data collection and
					preprocessing, LLM fine-tuning, testing, inference, and chat interface development. It
					supports fine-tuning multiple LLMs such as Zephyr, Mistral, Llama-3, Phi, Flan-T5, and
					user-provided models, with enhanced retrieval capabilities via retrieval-augmented
					generation (RAG). It also includes an automatic web crawling RAG data scraper and a human
					evaluation feature for model quality assessment.
					The system's capabilities are demonstrated through a university information chatbot, with
					comparative analysis of different LLMs using a benchmark crowd-sourced dataset.

				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This paper proposes a context-based crop recommendation system
					using a weather forecast model
					to improve farming practices in Bangladesh. The multivariate Stacked Bi-LSTM Network is used
					for accurate weather prediction, including rainfall, temperature, humidity, and sunshine.
					The system guides farmers in making informed decisions about planting, irrigation,
					harvesting, and more.
					It also alerts farmers about extreme weather conditions and provides knowledge-based crop
					recommendations for flood and drought-prone areas.</i>

				<li><b>A Suffix Independent Algorithm for Stemming Bangla Words using Finite State Transducer</b></li>
				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This study proposes and evaluates a suffix-independent stemming
					algorithm for Bangla language
					using a finite state transducer (FST)-based framework.
					The algorithm creates a dictionary of root words implemented as an FST, achieving high speed
					and no memory usage for vocabulary keeping.
					A novel stemmer dataset was developed to evaluate the algorithm's performance, resulting in
					96.58% detection accuracy and 96.34% stemming accuracy.
					The proposed scheme outperforms existing methods and demonstrates effectiveness through
					experiments.</i>

				</li>
				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This research work presents a transformer-based model to detect
					whether an assignment is
					AI-generated or human-written.
					The model was trained on a dataset of 5410 assignments, with 2742 being AI-generated and
					2668 being human-written.
					Among the explored transformer-based architectures, DistilBERT provided the highest accuracy
					of 92%.</i>

					<p>I have experience in programming using C++ and Python. I have finished several projects, such as
						a chatbot for university information, websites for evaluating students, a personal voice
						assistant, and a file locker that uses an encryption algorithm. Recently, I have been working on
						LLM and langchain. I am trying to retrain and finetuned the LLM models using the PEFT library. I
						have also completed machine learning projects such as fake note detection, human abnormality
						detection, brain tumour detection, and an intelligent chatbot. I have also finished some natural
						language processing projects, like an intelligent chatbot that uses LSTM, Bangla text
						summarization using a transformer model, Bangla keyboard error correction using a transformer
						model, a Bangla stemmer design, a Bangla word-to-vector conversion, and a chatbot that uses the
						seq2seq model. I also have experience in hardware projects such as Home Automation using IoT and
						an image processing project, Fake Bangladeshi currency detection using OpenCV. Furthermore, I
						have experience in database management using MySQL.</p>
