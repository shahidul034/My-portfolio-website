							title="Stemming is a preprocessing task for natural language processing that involves normalizing inflected words representing the same concept of the original word. Steaming is a process of text normalization that has many applications. There are many techniques for steaming of inflected words for different languages but very few works for Bangla word steaming. Therefore, stemming Bangla word is a unsolved problem. There are many different situations that can occur in Bangla language for word steaming. In this paper, we present a rule based algorithm to stem Bangla words. We developed the rules for infection detection for verb inflection, number inflection, and others. Using our rules, we developed a system to find the root word of Bangla words and found good performance. Sufficient examples are provided to explain the proposed system.">

							title="Stemming is a preprocessing task for Natural Language Processing(NLP) that involves normalizing inflected words representing the same concept of the original word. Steaming is a process of text normalization that transforms a slated word into its root form. It has a great impact in different applications in NLP and Natural Language Understanding. One of the biggest challenges in Bangla stemming is to collect the rules that are associated with Bangla word stemming and standard dataset for testing the accuracy. This paper presents a summery of rules associated with Bangla stemming and a gold standard dataset corpus which will helps to testify the stemming algorithm. We verify the rules and using our rules and corpus we tested with existing Bangla stemming algorithms and found that the proposed corpus makes a difference with existing techniques.">

							title="When a behavior is regarded as unusual in particular circumstances, it is termed abnormal. The term 'abnormal behavior' has many definitions depending on the situation. People sprinting in a field, for example, is regarded natural, but it appears weird if it occurs in a mall. Similarly, loitering in alleyways, arguing, or pushing each other in public places are all regarded weird in certain situations. Deep learning has been widely used in the computer vision sector in recent years, with considerable success in human activity recognition. The proposed technique helps in the detection of abnormal behavior under a variety of contexts, including background changes, the number of subjects (one, two people, or a crowd), and a variety of unusual human behaviors.">

						title="Motor imagery classification is an important area of research that aims to provide insights into the neural processes underlying motor control. By analyzing the patterns of brain activity related to imagined movement, researchers can better understand how the brain originates and controls voluntary movements. This knowledge can have significant implications for the development of novel therapies for neurological diseases that impact motor performance, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. In this study, the performance of three deep learning methods, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), were evaluated for the classification of motor imagery EEG data. The results of the study showed that DNNs and Bi-LSTM performed better than the other algorithms with Bi-LSTM obtaining the highest average accuracy 96.84%, sensitivity  95\%, specificity 98.72%, F1-score 96.80%. This finding highlights the potential of these methods for EEG-based BCI applications. Moreover, a detailed comparison of several deep learning methods for the classification of motor imagery was presented, providing useful insights for future research toward the development of efficient and accurate BCIs. In conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of DNNs and Bi-LSTM for the classification of motor imagery EEG data and their potential for use in the development of BCIs for neurological diseases. These findings can guide future research in the field and contribute to the development of more efficient and accurate BCIs.">
