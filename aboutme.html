        <h1>My Experiences</h1>
        <p>As a skilled programmer with proficiency in multiple programming languages, including C++ and Python, I have
            successfully completed various projects that showcase my expertise in software development. My areas of
            interest lie in machine learning, natural language processing, and database management. This summary
            highlights my achievements and experiences in these fields.</p>
        <h2>Machine Learning Projects:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chatbot for University Information: Developed a chatbot that utilizes natural language processing
                techniques to provide information about university services, such as course offerings, faculty details,
                and campus events.</li>
            <li>Personal Voice Assistant: Created a personal voice assistant that can perform tasks such as scheduling
                appointments, sending emails, and controlling smart home devices using voice commands.</li>
            <li>File Locker with Encryption Algorithm: Designed and implemented a secure file locker that employs an
                encryption algorithm to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>Retraining and Fine-tuning LLM Models: Utilizing the PEFT library, I have retrained and fine-tuned large
                language models (LLM) for various applications, including but not limited to language translation and
                text generation.</li>
            <li>Fake Note Detection: Developed a machine learning model that detects counterfeit notes using advanced
                image processing techniques.</li>
            <li>Human Abnormality Detection: Built a system that identifies abnormalities in human behavior, such as
                unusual movements or actions, using computer vision and deep learning algorithms.</li>
            <li>Brain Tumor Detection: Created a machine learning model that diagnoses brain tumors by analyzing medical
                images.</li>
            <li>Intelligent Chatbot: Developed a chatbot that leverages long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to engage
                in conversations and respond to user queries.</li>
            <li>Fake Bangladeshi Currency Detection: Created a system that detects counterfeit Bangladeshi currency
                using image processing techniques and OpenCV libraries.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Natural Language Processing Projects:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bangla Text Summarization: Implemented a transformer model that automatically summarizes Bengali texts,
                reducing their length while preserving essential information.</li>
            <li>Bangla Keyboard Error Correction: Designed a system that corrects spelling errors in Bengali text
                messages using a transformer model.</li>
            <li>Bangla Stemmer Design: Developed a Bangla stemmer that reduces words to their base form, enabling
                efficient searching and indexing of Bengali documents.</li>
            <li>Bangla Word-to-Vector Conversion: Created a model that converts Bengali words into numerical vectors,
                facilitating their use in machine learning algorithms.</li>
            <li>Seq2Seq Model Chatbot: Built a chatbot that utilizes sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models to generate
                responses to user inputs, allowing for more fluid and contextual conversations.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hardware Projects:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Home Automation using IoT: Developed a home automation system that integrates various IoT devices,
                enabling users to control lighting, temperature, and security systems remotely.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Database Management:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>MySQL Experience: Proficient in managing databases using MySQL, including creating tables,
                relationships, indexes, views, and performing CRUD operations.</li>
            <li>Oracle SQL Database Tutorial: If you're interested in learning about Oracle SQL databases, you can check out the comprehensive tutorial
                available on GitHub:
