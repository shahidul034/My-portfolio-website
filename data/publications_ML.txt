    <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
        <p> üéØ <i style="color: cadetblue;">Fake news dissemination is a critical problem, jeopardizing
                the reliability of information and eroding public confidence. Machine
                learning provides a solution by distinguishing between real and misleading news. In this
                study, we utilized various classifiers such as
                KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, LightGBM, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Random
                Forest, and Naive Bayes on an opensource dataset. Tf-idf (Term frequency-inverse
                document frequency) and Count vectorization were used for text preprocessing, and
                soft and hard voting ensembles were applied to the best three and five models to boost
                performance. Additionally, we employed
                BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and CNN (Convolutional
                Neural Network) models with various
                optimizers (adam, rmsprop, SGD, adadelta, and adagrad) to further improve
                classification. The BERT model, optimized with adam,
                achieved the highest accuracy of 99.93%, with perfect precision (100%) and high recall
                (99.84%). Furthermore, using Count
                vectorization for feature extraction, the soft voting ensemble of the top five models
                (LGBM, XGB, RF, DT, LR) achieved peak
                performance among all ensemble models, achieving 99.87% accuracy, with precision,
                recall, f1-score, MAE, MSE, RMSE, RAE,
                and RRSE of 99.83%, 99.88%, 99.86%, 0.13%, 0.13%, 3.66%, 0.27%, and 7.80%, respectively.
                The exhaustive experimentation
                confirms the applicability and efficiency of the recommended models in identifying fake
                news.</i></p>

        <p> üéØ <i style="color: cadetblue;">The dataset at hand is a unique resource, officially
                procured from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department, the sole government institution
                that diligently monitors weather through 35 strategically placed weather stations across
                the nation.
                This dataset is a treasure trove of actual data spanning several decades, from the
                inception of each weather station to the present.
                It has been meticulously restructured and processed into four (Rainfall, Temperature,
                Humidity, and Sunshine) key weather parameters, presented in a highly organized and
                accessible format.
                This format not only facilitates its use in the machine-learning training process but
                also opens up avenues for its application in climate research, weather forecasting, and
                a myriad of other statistical and machine-learning applications.</i></p>

    of Gastrointestinal Polyps from Endoscopic Images Using a Deep Learning Approach" 2024
    International Conference on Recent Progresses in Science, Engineering and Technology (Accepted)


    <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
        <p> üéØ <i style="color: cadetblue;">Research suggests that approximately 20-30% of adults aged
                50 and older have colorectal polyps, a prevalent type of gastrointestinal (GI) polyps
                detected during colonoscopy exams. An increased risk of cancer development is associated
                with certain polyps. Timely identification is essential for implementing preventative
                measures and preventing the advancement of polyps to cancer. Considering the importance
                of early diagnosis, this study was conducted to classify GI polyps using a deep-learning
                approach. The Gastrovision dataset was used for this study. The ResNet50 model
                pre-trained on ImageNet was employed for transfer learning, achieving training,
                validation, and testing accuracies of 91.99%, 92.29%, and 89%, respectively. The
                specificity, precision, and F1-score obtained were 98.97%, 97.16%, and 81.65%,
                respectively. A user interface has been built to assist users in selecting and
                identifying images as part of a decision support system for categorizing GI polyps from
                endoscopic images.</i></p>

    <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
        <p> üéØ <i style="color: cadetblue;">Hypertension or high blood pressure is the
                leading risk factor with the
                largest contribution to the burden of disease and mortality. Therefore, regular blood
                pressure (BP) checks are necessary to track hypertension and reduce risk. In light of
                this, we have proposed a noninvasive method for hypertension detection based on
                photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using deep learning techniques. A hybrid deep
                learning model consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent
                Unit (GRU) is introduced. First, PPG signals were acquired from 219 subjects, which
                underwent pre-processing steps. Then, hypertension was detected with satisfactory
                results by using our proposed model. Here, CNN is used to extract features in order to
                work better in classification tasks. Our proposed model constructed with CNN and GRU
                achieved an Accuracy of 85.00 %, Recall of 84.44 %, Precision of 87.77% and F1-score of
                86.08%. Our goal is to improve the medical industry by precisely detecting
                hypertension.</i></p>

    <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
        <p> üéØ <i style="color: cadetblue;">Motor imagery classification is an important
                area of research that aims
                to provide insights into the neural processes underlying motor control. By analyzing the
                patterns of brain activity related to imagined movement, researchers can better
                understand how the brain originates and controls voluntary movements. This knowledge can
                have significant implications for the development of novel therapies for neurological
                diseases that impact motor performance, such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. In this
                study, the performance of three deep learning methods, including Artificial Neural
                Networks (ANNs), Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
                (Bi-LSTM), were evaluated for the classification of motor imagery EEG data. The results
                of the study showed that DNNs and Bi-LSTM performed better than the other algorithms
                with Bi-LSTM obtaining the highest average accuracy 96.84%, sensitivity 95%, specificity
                98.72%, F1-score 96.80%. This finding highlights the potential of these methods for
                EEG-based BCI applications. Moreover, a detailed comparison of several deep learning
                methods for the classification of motor imagery was presented, providing useful insights
                for future research toward the development of efficient and accurate BCIs. In
                conclusion, this study demonstrated the effectiveness of DNNs and Bi-LSTM for the
                classification of motor imagery EEG data and their potential for use in the development
                of BCIs for neurological diseases. These findings can guide future research in the field
                and contribute to the development of more efficient and accurate BCIs.</i></p>

    <div class="abstract" style="display: none;">
        <p> üéØ <i style="color: cadetblue;">When a behavior is regarded as unusual in
                particular circumstances, it
                is termed abnormal. The term "abnormal behavior" has many definitions depending on the
                situation. People sprinting in a field, for example, is regarded natural, but it appears
                weird if it occurs in a mall. Similarly, loitering in alleyways, arguing, or pushing
                each other in public places are all regarded weird in certain situations. Deep learning
                has been widely used in the computer vision sector in recent years, with considerable
                success in human activity recognition. The proposed technique helps in the detection of
                abnormal behavior under a variety of contexts, including background changes, the number
                of subjects (one, two people, or a crowd), and a variety of unusual human behaviors.</i>
