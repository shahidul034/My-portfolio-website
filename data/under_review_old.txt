						softwareX)</b></li>
				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This software describes the development of a web application
					called
					the LLM QA Builder, designed to streamline the creation of LLM-based interactive chatbots
					for organizational information retrieval.
					The application integrates various development phases including data collection and
					preprocessing, LLM fine-tuning, testing, inference, and chat interface development. It
					supports fine-tuning multiple LLMs such as Zephyr, Mistral, Llama-3, Phi, Flan-T5, and
					user-provided models, with enhanced retrieval capabilities via retrieval-augmented
					generation (RAG). It also includes an automatic web crawling RAG data scraper and a human
					evaluation feature for model quality assessment.
					The system's capabilities are demonstrated through a university information chatbot, with
					comparative analysis of different LLMs using a benchmark crowd-sourced dataset.

				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This paper proposes a context-based crop recommendation system
					using a weather forecast model
					to improve farming practices in Bangladesh. The multivariate Stacked Bi-LSTM Network is used
					for accurate weather prediction, including rainfall, temperature, humidity, and sunshine.
					The system guides farmers in making informed decisions about planting, irrigation,
					harvesting, and more.
					It also alerts farmers about extreme weather conditions and provides knowledge-based crop
					recommendations for flood and drought-prone areas.</i>

				<li><b>A Suffix Independent Algorithm for Stemming Bangla Words using Finite State Transducer</b></li>
				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This study proposes and evaluates a suffix-independent stemming
					algorithm for Bangla language
					using a finite state transducer (FST)-based framework.
					The algorithm creates a dictionary of root words implemented as an FST, achieving high speed
					and no memory usage for vocabulary keeping.
					A novel stemmer dataset was developed to evaluate the algorithm's performance, resulting in
					96.58% detection accuracy and 96.34% stemming accuracy.
					The proposed scheme outperforms existing methods and demonstrates effectiveness through
					experiments.</i>

				<li><b>Detecting AI-Generated Assignments in Educational Evaluation: A Transformer-Based Approach</b>
				</li>
				<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝This research work presents a transformer-based model to detect
					whether an assignment is
					AI-generated or human-written.
					The model was trained on a dataset of 5410 assignments, with 2742 being AI-generated and
					2668 being human-written.
					Among the explored transformer-based architectures, DistilBERT provided the highest accuracy
					of 92%.</i>
