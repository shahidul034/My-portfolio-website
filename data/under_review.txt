<b>Enhancing English-to-Spanish Medical Translation of Large Language Models Using Enriched Chain-of-Dictionary Framework(Submitted to EMNLP 2025)</b>
<i style="color: cadetblue;">📝MedCOD is a hybrid framework that improves English–Spanish medical translation by integrating UMLS-based structured knowledge into LLMs through prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Using a parallel MedlinePlus corpus and annotated test set, MedCOD boosts performance across four open-source models—e.g., Phi-4 achieved BLEU 44.23 and COMET 0.863, outperforming GPT-4o. Both structured prompting and fine-tuning independently aid translation, with their combination yielding the best results.
